# Project MySQL
Exams project for database class at CPH Business

The goal of this project was to create a relational database for the volunteer organization Ungdommens RÃ¸de Kors (www.urk.dk) to manage the yearly summer camp for vulnerable children. 

The database aims to solve the work involved with managing info about the children, allocation to groups based on age and rooms to sleep, assignment of adult volunteers to care for the groups and finally the weekly activity schedule.

The 5 SQL files should be loaded into the mysql database in order.

* `1_urk_db_structure.sql`
* `2_urk_db_dataload.sql`
* `3_urk_db_stored-procedures.sql`
* `4_urk-db-svar-paa-krav.sql`
* `5_urk-db-extra-queries.sql`
